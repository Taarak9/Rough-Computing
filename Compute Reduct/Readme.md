Write functions for the following. Some of the functions work with a given information/decision system  in a tabular form. Usually the information/decision system is read from a text file.

Consider a Decision System DS: :<U, Union(A,{d})>

1.      To obtain discernibility matrix

2.      To construct a Boolean function representing the discernibility of an element x. Say BF(x).

3.      Consider R=IND(B) for an attribute subset  B. Write a function to show that BF(x) =BF(y) if y belongs to [x]R

4.      To obtain the characteristic formula of the system DS and its simplification/representation as a normal form

5.      To obtain all the basic formulae of the system DS.  Say a set of attributes in a basic formula as one Reduct.

6.      To obtain the intersection of all the sets of attributes corresponding to basic formulae, That is to compute the intersection of all Reducts.  Say this set as CORE.
