Write functions for the following. Some of the functions work with a given information/decision system  in a tabular form. Usually the information system/decision system is read from a text file.
1.      To list out all possible Indiscernibility relation of a given Decision System DS:<U, Union(A,{d})>
2.      To obtain an equivalence class for a given element x of U with respect to an Indiscernibility relation “R”.  Say [x]R.  
3.      To demonstrate  [x]R=[y]R  if xRy  otherwise Intersection([x]R,[y]R )=Null_Set
4.      To collect all equivalence classes of U with respect to a given indiscernibility relation “R”.  Say  U/R={[x]R|x belongs to U}
5.      To demonstrate U/R is a partition of U and further the cardinality of U/R is the same as the cardinality of V(B). Here R is "INDDS(B)" for a given subset B of A and V(B) is the unique value combination of domain values of attributes in B realized in DS.
6.      Let IND(B1) and IND(B2) be two Indiscernibility relations where B1, B2 are subsets of A
a.      To demonstrate “INDDS(B1) and INDDS(B2)”,  is also an Indiscernibility relation equivalent to INDDS(Union(B1 , B2)).
b.      To demonstrate U/INDDS(Union(B1 , B2))  is refrainment of U/INDDS(B1) and U/INDDS(B2)
7.      To demonstrate U/INDDS(Union(A,{d})) is refinement of all possible partitions induced by Indiscernibility relations of a given Decision System DS:<U, Union(A,{d})> .
 
Note:  A relation  R  induced by a subset B of AÈ{d} over U is  an Indiscernibility relation.  Say R=IND(B).
