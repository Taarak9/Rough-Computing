Write functions for the following. Some of the functions work with a given information system  in a tabular form. Usually the information system is read from a text file.

1.     To provide partition of the tuples of the table for a given attribute (a name in the Heading of the table)

2.     Using the function of task 1, compute partitions for all the attributes of the tabl

3.     To produce a simple set of given set A

 

4.     To produce frequency table of elements of given set A

 

5.     To get the cardinality of a given set A 

 

6.     To get the cardinality of the corresponding simple set of a given set A.

 

7.     To get the complement of a given set A.

 

8.     To produce

(a) intersection,

(b) Union,

(c) set difference of given two sets A and B

 

9.     To develop boolean functions for testing whether

(a) is A a subset of B 

(b) is A equals to B

 

10.     To develop a boolean flag vector corresponding to elements of a given partition P,

(a)  is A  a super set of element of P 

(b) is A has non-trivial intersection with the element of P.

11.      To obtain the union of elements of the given partition P for which the flags are one (true) based on  

(a) super set flags 

(b) non-trivial intersection flags for a given set A. 

The resultant sets will be referred as Lower Approximation of A and Upper Approximation of A respectively with respective to the partition P.

12.      Develop an algorithm  which returns Lower and Upper Approximations of given set A with respective to given Partition P.  Name this function as f_LUSA(A,P)  let us denote the return values of the algorithm as LSA and USA
 
13.      To obtain the set difference of USA and LSA.   Say this resultant set as Boundary set  of A denoted as BNA.

14.      To obtain the complement set of USA.   Say this resultant set as Negative set  of A denoted as NGA.

15.      Develop an algorithm to get the Cardinality of sets A, U, LSA, USA,  BNA and NGA with respective to a Partition P obtained from  an attribute of given Information System or Decision System.  Say the output of this algorithm as n_A, N_U, n_LSA, n_USA, n_BNA and n_NGA  respectively.

16.      To verify that LSA, BNA and NGA of given set A with respect to a given  Partition P is a partition of U, the Universal set.
