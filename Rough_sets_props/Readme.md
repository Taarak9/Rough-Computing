Write functions for the following. Some of the functions work with a given information system  in a tabular form. Usually the information system is read from a text file.


Consider a Decision System DS: :<U, Union(A,{d})>

Consider B, B1, B2 subset of A

Consider D,D1,D2 as Union(B,{d},  Union(B,{d}) , Union(B,{d}) respectively.

 
1.     To obtain P=U/INDDS(B) , P1=U/INDDS(B1), P2=U/INDDS(B2), Q=U/INDDS(D), Q1=U/INDDS(D1), Q2=U/INDDS(D2) and S=U/INDDS({d})

2.     To demonstrate Q, Q1 and Q3 are refinements of P and S, P1 and S & P2 and S respectively.

3.     To obtain  LSA,USA,BNA,NGA for each element of S considering the
       * a.      P
       * b.      P1
       * c.      P2
       * d.      Q
       * e.      Q1
       * f.      Q2

4.     To obtain the Accuracy of Approximation of each element of S considering the
       * a.      P
       * b.      P1
       * c.      P2
       * d.      Q
       * e.      Q1
       * f.      Q2

5.     To obtain the Rough Membership  of each element of U considering the
       * a.      P
       * b.      P1
       * c.      P2
       * d.      Q
       * e.      Q1
       * f.      Q2

6.     To obtain the Degree of Dependency  of “d” considering the
       * a.      B
       * b.      B1
       * c.      B2
            
7.     To obtain Dispensable and Indispensable attributes of DS
